latex_output.py:
It would be nice to test the latex_output.py script as part of the "small test".
In the paper, the generated LaTeX table should appear in its own file, to reduce the possibility of cut-and-paste errors.
In latex_output.py, say where the output should be copied to.

parent_merges_test.py:
Rather than using `zip_longest` to interleave testing to reduce the probability that tests at the same hash happen in parallel, I suggest using a lock file.  If the output directory already exists but the results file does not, then just wait for the result.

intellimerge.sh:
Why is it required that all of m1a, m2a, and m3a differ.  Isn't it enough for any one of them to differ?
