# bash, not POSIX sh, because of "readarray".

# This script edits files in place to remove conflict markers related to Java
# imports.  For a given conflict that involves only `import` statements and
# blank lines, the output includes every `import` statement that is in either
# of the parents.  This script leaves other conflicts untouched.

# Usage:
#   resolve-import-conflicts [file ...]
#
# The script works on all files given on the command line.
# If none are given, the script works on all files in or under the current directory.
#
# The exit status code is 0 (success) if all conflicts are resolved in all the files.
# The exit status code is 1 (failure) if any conflict remains.

# This script is not a git mergetool.  A git mergetool is given the base, parent 1, and
# parent 2 files, all without conflict markers.
# However, this can be run after a git mergetool that leaves conflict markers
# in files, as the default git mergetool does.
